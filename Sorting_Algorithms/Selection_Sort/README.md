In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort.
It has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

Step 1 - Set MIN to location 0
Step 2 - Search the minimum element in the list
Step 3 - Swap with value at location MIN
Step 4 - Increment MIN to point to next element
Step 5 - Repeat until list is sorted
