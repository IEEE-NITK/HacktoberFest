# IEEE QuizMaker

The idea is to write a quiz maker(terminal based, mostly) which reads a set of
questions and their answers from a text file.

## Possible Features
* Quiz has to be timed.
* If the user loses connection with the server, he should be able to connect
    back and have his answers already loaded.
* The server should be able to handle multiple participants at once. 
* It should be almost JEE styled.
* More ideas are welcome!
